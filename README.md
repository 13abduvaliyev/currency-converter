## Instructions

1. **Setup the Project:**
   - Create a new folder named `currency-converter`.
   - Inside the folder, create a Python script file named `converter.py`.

2. **API Integration:**
   - Use the URL: [https://nbu.uz/uz/exchange-rates/json/](https://nbu.uz/uz/exchange-rates/json/) to fetch the exchange rates.
   - Parse the JSON data using Python's `json` module.

3. **User Input:**
   - Ask the user to input:
     - The amount of money they want to convert.
     - The currency they want to convert from.
     - The currency they want to convert to.

4. **Perform Conversion:**
   - Calculate the converted amount based on the exchange rate.

5. **Display Results:**
   - Show the user the result of the conversion in a clear format.

6. **Bonus Tasks (Optional):**
   - Add error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., unsupported currencies or invalid numbers).
   - Allow the user to perform multiple conversions without restarting the program.
   - Save the conversion history to a file.
